# Learning basics of C++ - Sorting algorithms, computational complexity
> Training course - Pasja Informatyki, C++ course, episode 14 ( [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKiaoV86iJo) )

## General info
Sorting algorithms. Computational complexity O. Bubble sort and quicksort. Comparison of algorithms with time measurement. The program asks the user how big the array to sort should be. The array is then dynamically allocated. Populating both arrays with the same random numbers. Then the sorting is made using both sorting algorithms and the result is shown on the screen. The user can also see the array before and after sorting (uncomment the appriopriate lines).

## Technologies
* C++
* CodeBlocks (IDE)
* GNU GCC Compiler (minGW)
